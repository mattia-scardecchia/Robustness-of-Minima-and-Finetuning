## Robustness metrics

In this folder we have saved the metrics that we computed on the pretraining checkpoints. These include robustness to random perturbation of inputs (Gaussian noise, random masking), to adversarial perturbation of the inputs (Fast Gradient Signed Attack), to random perturbation of weights (local energy). We also looked at the loss function along the line joining different checkpoints in weight space.
